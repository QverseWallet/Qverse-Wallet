# Qverse Wallet (Chrome Extension ¬∑ MV3)

**Qverse is an open-source wallet for the Qubitcoin network.**
Minimal, retail-friendly UI, built as a Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) with a simple, auditable codebase. No telemetry, no trackers.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Chrome MV3** (Service Worker background).
- **Local encrypted vault** (password-based; PBKDF2 ‚Üí AES-GCM).
- **Create / import accounts**, manage multiple addresses.
- **Transaction signing & send flow.**
- **Lightweight UI** (popup) and basic options.
- **Minimal permissions** (see `manifest.json`), privacy-first.

> **Security disclaimer:** Early-stage, community software. Always test with small amounts first. You are responsible for securing your keys and environment.

---

## üß± Architecture (High Level)
- **`manifest.json`** ‚Äî MV3 entry point & permissions.
- **Background (Service Worker)** ‚Äî core logic, session handling/orchestration.
- **Popup UI** ‚Äî create/unlock vault, accounts, send flow.
- **Options page** ‚Äî basic configuration (e.g., endpoints).
- **Offscreen/Workers** ‚Äî cryptographic operations & session TTL (avoid blocking UI).
- **Crypto libs (`app/js/`)** ‚Äî ECDSA/secp256k1, hashing (SHA-256/RIPEMD-160/SHA-512), AES, PBKDF2.

### Security Model
- **Password-derived key** via PBKDF2 with per-vault **salt**, used for **AES-GCM** encryption with random **IV**.
- **Per-session unlock** with timeout (TTL) to reduce secret exposure.
- **All secrets stay local** (Chrome storage). Only required blockchain/explorer calls are made to configured endpoints.
- **Strict CSP** and minimal permissions to reduce attack surface.

> **Hardening ideas (roadmap):** raise KDF iterations, add integrity checks, unit tests/fuzzing for tx builders, reproducible builds, third-party audit.

## üöÄ Install (from source)
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Chrome ‚Üí `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project folder (the one containing `manifest.json`).
   - If you introduce a build step later, load the `dist/` folder instead.

The wallet icon should appear in your toolbar.

## üìÇ Typical Project Layout
```
Qverse-Wallet/
‚îú‚îÄ manifest.json
‚îú‚îÄ popup/               # UI (create/unlock, accounts, send)
‚îú‚îÄ background/          # service worker
‚îú‚îÄ options/             # configuration page
‚îú‚îÄ offscreen/           # crypto/session helpers (optional)
‚îú‚îÄ app/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ js/               # crypto primitives (hashing, ECDSA, AES, PBKDF2)
‚îî‚îÄ README.md
```

> Keep any legacy/demo third-party code outside the packaged build (e.g., under `third_party/`) and retain the original licenses.

---

## üõ† Development
- No build is strictly required. If you later add bundling:
  ```bash
  npm i
  npm run build
  ```
- Load `dist/` as the unpacked extension after building.
- Use **Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) for clean history.

---

## üîí Permissions & Privacy
- Minimal MV3 permissions declared in `manifest.json`.
- `host_permissions` limited to necessary explorer/RPC endpoints.
- No analytics, no tracking scripts.

---

## üôå Based On / Credits
Qverse reuses portions and ideas from **OutCast3k/coinbin** (https://github.com/OutCast3k/coinbin), licensed under **MIT**.
Thanks to coinbin and related open-source crypto libraries (coinjs/ec primitives, hashing, etc.) for their contribution to the ecosystem.

> Third-party components remain under their respective licenses. Keep copyright headers and attribution.

---

## üó∫ Roadmap
- Hardware-wallet integration (e.g., Ledger; opt-in blind signing).
- Full activity view with confirmations/unconfirmed balance.
- Network switcher & endpoint presets.
- i18n (EN/ES).
- Unit tests for crypto utilities and transaction builders.
- Security review / external audit.

## ü§ù Contributing
1. Open an Issue for bugs or feature requests.
2. Fork the repo and create a branch: `feat/<name>` or `fix/<name>`.
3. Use Conventional Commits and keep PRs small and focused.
4. If a change affects the UI, include screenshots.

## üõ° Security Policy
If you discover a vulnerability, please report it **responsibly**:
- Prefer a GitHub Issue labeled `security` (avoid pasting sensitive details publicly).
- Alternatively, email the maintainers (add a contact in your fork).

We aim to acknowledge reports within **7 days** and provide a remediation plan as soon as feasible.
Scope: this extension‚Äôs code (MV3 service worker, popup, options, offscreen/crypto helpers) and build scripts in this repo.

**Please do not** disclose 0-days publicly before coordination or submit exploits targeting end-users.
